Dynamic NAT (Network Address Translation) Configuration
  1. ip nat inside (int config)
  2. ip nat outside (int config)
  3. ACL configuration for packets entering inside interfaces
  4. ip nat pool [name] [first-address] [last-address] netmask [subnet-mask] (global config) -> pool of public registred IP addresses
  5. ip nat inside source list [acl-number] pool [pool-name] (fglobal config) -> enable dynamic NAT
  
PAT (Port Address Translation) Configuration
  1. ip nat inside (int config)
  2. ip nat outside (int config)
  3. configure ACL  for packets entering inside interfaces
  4. ip nat inside source list [acl-number] interface [type/number] overload

ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DYNAMIC NAT AND PAT IS "overload"

Biggest NAT troublshooting issues
  1. Reversed inside and outside
  2. static NAT -check lists the inside local address first and inside global IP address second
  3. Dynamic NAT (ACL) ensure ACL configured matches host packets
  4. Dynamic NAT (pool)  if not enough IP Addresses use PAT
  5. PAT - Dont forget OVERLOAD in configuration
  6. ACL - IOS Processes ACL before NAT, 
  7. User traffic required -> NAT needs user trafic
  8. IPV4 routing
