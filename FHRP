First Hop Redundancy Protocol
 a. the category of protocols that can be used so that the hostts take advantage of redunant routers in a subnet
 b. redunancy is needed due to single points of failure
 c. FHRP can make redunant routers act as one router
  1. All hosts act like they always have with one default router
  2. Default routers share a virtual IP address in the subment defined by the FHRP
  3. Hosts use the FHRP virtual IP address as default gateway
  4. Routers exchange FHRP protocol messages so they both agree as to who does what
  5. When a router fails the routers use the FHRP to choose which router takes over responsibilities
3 different FHRP protocols
  1. HSRP - Hot Standby Router Protocol - Cisco  -Active/standby -Subnet load balancing
  2. VRRP - Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol - RFC 5798 - Active/standby - Subnet load Balancing
  3. GLBP - Gateway Load Balancing Protocol - Cisco -Active/active - host load balancing
