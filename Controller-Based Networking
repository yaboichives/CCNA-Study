Data Plane aka fowarding plane
  a. All the tasks internally done to foward a packet
Control Plane
  a. Any action that controls the data plane
    1. creation of all the tables that the data plane uses to do its job
      i. ip routing table
      ii. arp table
      iii. mac address table
    2. protocols like
      i. OSPF
      ii. EIGRP
      iii.RIP
      iV. BGP
      v. arp
      vi. IPV6 negighbor discovery protocol (ndp)
      vii. Switch mac learning
      iix. stp
Management Plane
  a. any action that controls the control plane
    1. protocols like
      i. Telnet
      ii. SSH
      
Controllers and Software-Defined Architecture or SDA
  1. Southbound Interface
    a. Controller sits at the top and sends directly to network device's dataplanes
    b. SBI examples
      1. Openflow
      2. Opflex
      3. CLI and SNMP with Cisco APIC-EM
      4. CLI and SNMP and NETCONF used with Cisco Software Defined Access
  2. Northbound
    a. Cointroller gathers information about the network
    b. Uses API so other programs can talk with it
      i. REST = Representation State Transfer - can sit on different hosts using http to transfer data over the API
        1. uses HTTP GET requests but goes to an object on the controller rather than a URL
        2. controller sends back an HTTP GET respones with the object
 
 Network Programmability and SDN
  a. OpenDaylight Controller and OpenFlow
    1. Open Source  and uses linux
  b. Cisco Applicatioin Centric Infrastructure (ACI)
    1. Spine and Leafe or Clos network
      a. Each leaf switch mus=t connect to every spine switch
      b. Each Spine switch must connect to every leaf switch
      c. Leaf switches cannot connect to each other
      d. Spine  switches cannot connect to each other
      e. Endpoints only connect to leaf switches.
  c. Cisco APIC Enterprise Module (APIC-EM)
  
Application Centric INfrastructure
  1. Because Datacenters host applications and need networking specific to the application infrastructure
  2. ACI's use centralized controller called - Application Policy Infrastructure Controller or (APIC)
    a. Takes intent (EPGs, Policies) and comptletely changes the operation model away from configuring VLANs, trunks, etherchannels, acls and so on
    
Cisco APIC Enterpise Module
a. offer enterpise SDN using the same switches and routers already installe din networks
  i. Toplogy maps
  ii. path trace
  iii. Plug and Play
  iV. Easy QoS
  V. Interacts with management plane via, telnet, ssh or SNMP
  
SDN examples
Traditional Versues Controller-BAsed Networks

Network managment
  a. Configuration managment
    1. any feature that changes device configuration with automated configuration managment doing so with software control
      a. ACI using the APIC controller
      b. NetCONF/RESTCONF
      c. Ansible, puppet, chef
  b. Operational Management
    1. monitoring, gathering operational data, reporting, and alerting possible issues
      a. APIC-EM and DNA Center
   
  
  How Automation IMpacts Network Management
    1. Formalize and define dta models for config and operatin data about networks.
