REST-Based APIs
  1. API = Application programming interface
    a. Client/server architecture
      i. app developer makes a REST api - that api is a REST server. Any other app can now make a REST API call (REST Client).
      ii. REST Api Call sent out, REST api Server sends back data
    b. Stateless operation
      i. REST does not record and use information about one API exchange for purpose of subsequent API Exchanges
    c. Clear statement of cacheable/ uncacheable
      i. RES APIs require that any resource requested via API mark whether or not a resource is is cacheable or not to improve performance by retriieving resources less often. 
    d. Uniform interface
    e. Layerd
    f. Code-on-demand
    
    Software CRUD actions and HTTP Verbs
      a. CRUD
        1. C= create - allows client to create new instance sof variables and data structures at the server and initialize their values as kept at the server
        2. r = Read - allows client to retrieve current value of variable s that exist a tht eserver, stroring a copy of th evariables, structures, and values at the client
        3. u = update - allows client to change the value of variables that exist at the server
        4. D = delete - allows the client to delete from the server different instances of data variables
        
        Crud verbs - REST (HTTP) Verb
          1. Create = POST
          2. Read = GET
          3. Update = PATCH, PUT
          4. Delete = DELETE
          
    REST Api resource contains a set of relate dvariables, defined byh the API and identified by a URI
     Data Serialization: Because REST APIs give out data they usually do it in 3 diff types
      a. JSON
      b. XML
      c. YAML
    
    Make sure you know JSON
