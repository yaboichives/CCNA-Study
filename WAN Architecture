Metro Ethernet
  1. acts as if the WAN service were created by one Ethernet switch. 
  2. The service is a Layer 2 service in that the WAN provider fowards Ethernet frames form one customer device to another. 
  
Metro Ethernet Physical Design and Topology
  1. Physical link between the SP and customer is the Access link or Ethernet Access link
  2. Anything on th elink is called user network interface or UNI
  3. Service provider promises certain speeds but there network infrastructure and information are hidden to the user. 
Ethernet WAN services and Topologies
  a. There are 3 main types of MEF service Types
    1. Ethernet Line Service or E-Line - point to point - two customers premise equipment (CPE) Devices can exchange Ethernet frames  like a leased line
      a. Routers would use physical Ethernet interfaces
      b. The routers would configure IP Addresses in the same subnet as each other
      c. Their routing protocols would become neighbors and exchange routes
      d. Point to point EVC or Ethernet Virtual Connection
      e. Typically use Routers but a swtich is possible because its over ethernet
    2. Ethernet Lan Service - E-LAN  - Full Mesh - This Service acts like a LAN, in that all devices can send frames to all other devices.
      a. 
    3. Ethernet Tree Service E-Tree - Hub and Spoke, partial mesh; point to multi-point - Central site can communicate to a defined set of remote sites, but the remote sites cannot communicate directly. 
  b. VPWS or Virtual Private Wire Service = E-Line Service
  c. VPLS or Virtual Private Lan Service = E-LAN Service 
  d. EoMPLS - Ethernet over MPLS - Service Provider uses MPLS internall to make an Ethernet WAN service.
