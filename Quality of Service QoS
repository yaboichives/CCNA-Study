QoS  - manages what happens  to a packet when it enters a switch
DIKTA
1. a,b,c
2. a,d
3. a,b,d
4. c,b
5. b,c
6. c,d

QoS manages
  1. Bandwith
    a. Speed of the link, through capacity of each type of traffic
  2. Delay
    a. One way - time between sending one packet and that same packet arriving at the destination
    b. Round-trip - Counts the one-way delay plus the time for the receiver to send back a packet
  3. Jitter
    a. variation in one-way delay between consecutive packets send by the same application
  4. Loss
    a. number of lost messages, typically as a percentage\
    
 Types of traffic
  a. Voice  - affected by delay, jitter, and loss, not so much bandwith though
    1. Delay (one-way): 150 ms or less
    2. Jitter 30 ms or less
    3. Loss: 1% or less
  b. Video  - affected by delay, jitter, and loss, not so much bandwith though
    1. Bandwith - 384kbps to 20 mbps
    2. Delay (one-way) 200-400 ms
    3. 30-50 ms
    4. loss 0.1% - 1%

 Quality of Experience QoE - users' perception of their use of the application on the network
  
Classification and Marking - Classifies packets based on header content and may modify bits in specific header fields.
  1. Enabled on an interface
  2. Are directional like ACLs
    a. entering 
    b. exiting
  
Foward->classify->Queue->Scheduling(prioritization)->Transmit

NBAR- Cisco Network Based Application Recognition - Identifies the differences of importance between applications. Like Amazon video vs cisco video surveillance camera

Marking Fields n- Relies on IPv4's Type of Service (ToS) bye in the IPv4 header
  1. DSCP - Differentiated Services Code Point
    a. 6 bit field from IPv6 - Traffic Class byte
  2. CoS - Class of Service or Priority Code Point or PCP
    a. 802.1Q header  on the 3rd byte of the 4-byte 802.1Q header. 3 bit field supplying 8 possible values.
    [Ethernet][802.1Q][Type][Data][/trailer]
    b. 802.1Q header only exists when 802.1Q Trunking is used on a link
    
Trust Boundary - Where the boundary for tursting the current QoS markings starts
  a. Typically a device that the IT staff controls
    1. Except for VOIP Phones - Where the phone is the trust boundary so they get good QoS.

DiffServ Suggested marking Values - Makes suggestions about specific DSCP values hoping to create consistent use of DSCP values in all networks. 
  1. Expedited Fowarding 
  2. Assured Fowarding
  3. Class Selector
