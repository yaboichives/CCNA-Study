DIKTA
1. a,b,c
2. a,d
3. a,b,d
4. c,b
5. b,c
6. c,d

QoS manages
  1. Bandwith
    a. Speed of the link, through capacity of each type of traffic
  2. Delay
    a. One way - time between sending one packet and that same packet arriving at the destination
    b. Round-trip - Counts the one-way delay plus the time for the receiver to send back a packet
  3. Jitter
    a. variation in one-way delay between consecutive packets send by the same application
  4. Loss
    a. number of lost messages, typically as a percentage\
    
 Types of traffic
  a. Voice  - affected by delay, jitter, and loss, not so much bandwith though
    1. Delay (one-way): 150 ms or less
    2. Jitter 30 ms or less
    3. Loss: 1% or less
  b. Voice  - affected by delay, jitter, and loss, not so much bandwith though
   
 
 Quality of Experience QoE - users' perception of their use of the application on the network
